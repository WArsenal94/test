    <h1>My Life Story</h1>
  <section>
    <p>I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Washington State University two years ago, and I currently work as a systems design engineer in the Seattle area.</p>
     <p>I enrolled myself in this certificate with the hope of switching to software engineering.</p>

  <h2>My Future Goals</h2>
  <p>I am planning to switch my career first, and then I am planning to move to Seattle after this pandemic is over</p>
 <p>I also plan to gain back the weight I lost because of the lockdown. I am scared to go to the gym again, which is why I lost weight.</p>
